scale free measures:
	correlations —> proportion of variability in b is explained by a —> r^2
		—> smoothers, scale binsize when scaling x
	-for binary outcome we measures (mean_diff)/(variability_within_calss)
	-necesary that (variability_within_class) and (mean_difference) are on the same scale
	-this is the advantage of std.dev, it is a scale free measure because of the sqr-root

semi-pivotal measures —> the only way to make data trully scale-free is to use SD.
	—> using SD ensures that the dispersion of the data is standardized across data sets.
	—> Dispersion of the data is essential, along with scale-free property, 
	because a few genes with large dispersion can confound ability to find outliers.
		—> well-behaved genes have small tails, narrow distribution
		—> wild genes have large tails, wide distributions
		—> If you use measures of variability like:
			absolute average difference or Inter-quartile range
		the distribtuions for the wild genes will still be wider than the well-behaved genes
		the result being, when you look at the tails for the outliers, 
		you will preferentially find genes from the “wild” group, 
		even though these may not be as unusual expression levels for these genes.
		—> If you use a STD to measure variability and normalize,
		the distributions for the wild and well-behaved genes will be equally wide,
		the result being, when you look at the tails for outliers, 
		you will find true outliers, with an unbiased chance of picking wild and well-behaved genes
